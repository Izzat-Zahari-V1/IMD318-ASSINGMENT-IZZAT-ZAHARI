            My name is muhammad Izzat Bin zahari. Born and living, in Kuala Lumpur with my parents and two more sister. I am of class N5CDIM1105C of UiTM Campus Rembau. Im on my final semester of stying in Diploma of Infromation Management. 
            The creation of this short introduction is coincided with the web assignment of IMD318, Introduction to Web Content Management and Design. 
            My hobby consist of Photography and gaming.</p>

            <p>As the graduation day draws closer, I will say that the 2 and a half years have been a rollercoaster of emotion, experience and stories as well as friends I make across the time im studying here.</p>

            <p>I was ecstatic to learn that I had been admitted to study here. This is because, like everyone else, I experienced anxiety while I awaited the official release for the UPU results. But as I played this anxious game, I repeatedly told myself that I will be fine, and it did. After my anxiety was relieved, the space it had occupied was swiftly filled with joy, excitement, and a lack of patience as I began a new chapter in my life. The thrill of meeting new people and gaining fresh knowledge like everyone, I was filled with hopes and fear in every second that my body in a state of alive. The uncertainty of life surely a hell of a disease. So, I march on trough this chaotic, poetic state of existence called life. I hope to be successful and graduate from this university with great grades and hope to be more confident in myself in studying here.</p>

            <p>My ambition? A successful curator or even an archivist working at prestigious institution in the country. History, or even vintage item have long been passion of mine, the stories from the Heroic age of Arctic Exploration, The Second Malaya Emergency, The Space Race have been the talks of my neurons as long as I can remember. There, grow an appreciation for history and the preservation of it. One thing led to another and here I am, looking at the past as my future. I knew from the beginning that to achieve something, I need to work hard to realize this old dream of mine. The first step has been taken; learn diligently in this course</p>

            <p>I got to admit, those ambition are young naïve and dumb adding tio that it is born out of reactionary of my current learning course but if that’s the way, I prefer it that way to for my future. I got a glimpse of it through the internship program at the Planetarium. I enjoy my 8 weeks stay there is and quite ecited for the future that will come.
